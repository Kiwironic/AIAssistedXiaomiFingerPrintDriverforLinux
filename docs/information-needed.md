# Information Required for Driver Development

This document outlines all the information needed to successfully reverse engineer and port the fingerprint scanner driver to Linux.

## Critical Hardware Information

### 1. Device Identification
- [ ] **Vendor ID (VID)** and **Product ID (PID)** - Found in Device Manager
- [ ] **Device name/model** - Exact model number
- [ ] **Manufacturer** - Company that made the scanner
- [ ] **Interface type** - USB 2.0/3.0, PCI, etc.
- [ ] **Device class** - How Windows categorizes it

### 2. Current Windows Driver Details
- [ ] **Driver files location** - Usually in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\
- [ ] **Driver version** - From Device Manager properties
- [ ] **Driver date** - When it was released
- [ ] **Associated software** - Any vendor software installed
- [ ] **Registry entries** - Device-specific registry keys

## Windows System Analysis

### 3. Driver Files Needed
Please provide these files from your Windows system:
- [ ] **Main driver file** (.sys file from drivers folder)
- [ ] **User-mode libraries** (.dll files if any)
- [ ] **INF file** - Driver installation information
- [ ] **Device firmware** - If stored as separate files

### 4. System Information
- [ ] **Windows version** - Windows 10/11, build number
- [ ] **Architecture** - x64/x86
- [ ] **How the scanner currently works** - What software uses it?
- [ ] **Supported features** - Enrollment, verification, etc.

## Hardware Testing Information

### 5. Device Behavior
- [ ] **Power requirements** - How much power it draws
- [ ] **LED indicators** - What lights up and when
- [ ] **Physical interface** - How users interact with it
- [ ] **Scan area size** - Dimensions of the scanning surface
- [ ] **Image resolution** - If known from specs

### 6. Functional Testing
- [ ] **Enrollment process** - How fingerprints are registered
- [ ] **Verification speed** - How fast it recognizes prints
- [ ] **Error conditions** - What happens when scan fails
- [ ] **Multi-user support** - Can it store multiple users?

## Technical Analysis Requirements

### 7. USB Communication (if USB device)
I'll need you to:
- [ ] **Run hardware detection script** - Execute the script I created
- [ ] **Capture USB traffic** - Using Wireshark during device operation
- [ ] **Device enumeration logs** - When device is plugged in
- [ ] **Operation traces** - During fingerprint scan/enrollment

### 8. Windows Driver Analysis
- [ ] **Access to Windows system** - To run analysis tools
- [ ] **Administrator privileges** - To access driver files
- [ ] **Ability to install tools** - For reverse engineering
- [ ] **USB packet capture** - During device operations

## Development Environment

### 9. Linux System Details
- [ ] **Fedora version** - Exact version (you mentioned Fedora 42)
- [ ] **Kernel version** - Output of `uname -r`
- [ ] **Development tools** - gcc, make, kernel headers installed?
- [ ] **USB development libs** - libusb, etc.

### 10. Testing Capabilities
- [ ] **Physical access to device** - Can test on actual hardware
- [ ] **Multiple test systems** - Different Linux distros if possible
- [ ] **Backup/restore ability** - In case something goes wrong
- [ ] **Virtual machine access** - For safe testing

## Immediate Next Steps

### What You Can Do Right Now:

1. **Run the hardware detection script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x tools/hardware-info.sh
   ./tools/hardware-info.sh
   ```
   (Results will be saved automatically to hardware-analysis/ directory)

2. **Get Windows device information:**
   - Open Device Manager
   - Find your fingerprint scanner
   - Right-click → Properties → Details
   - Select "Hardware Ids" from dropdown
   - Copy all the information

3. **Locate Windows driver files:**
   - Check C:\Windows\System32\drivers\ for .sys files
   - Look for manufacturer-specific folders
   - Note any associated software installed

4. **Check device functionality:**
   - Test current fingerprint enrollment/verification
   - Note any special software required
   - Document the user experience

## Priority Information

### Most Critical (Need First):
1. **VID:PID** - Device identification
2. **Driver .sys file** - Main Windows driver
3. **Hardware detection output** - From the script
4. **Device behavior** - How it currently works

### Important (Need Soon):
1. **USB packet captures** - Communication protocol
2. **Registry analysis** - Device configuration
3. **Complete driver package** - All related files

### Nice to Have:
1. **Multiple device variants** - If you have different models
2. **Performance metrics** - Speed, accuracy, etc.
3. **Compatibility matrix** - What works/doesn't work

## Questions for You:

1. **What's the exact model/brand of your fingerprint scanner?**
2. **Is it built into a laptop or a standalone USB device?**
3. **What software currently uses it on Windows?** (Windows Hello, vendor software, etc.)
4. **Do you have access to the Windows system where it's working?**
5. **Are you comfortable running command-line tools and scripts?**
6. **Do you have development experience, or should I focus on automated tools?**

Once you provide this information, I can create targeted analysis tools and begin the actual reverse engineering process.
