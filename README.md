# Linux Fingerprint Scanner Driver

A reverse-engineered Linux driver for fingerprint scanners, ported from Windows drivers.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive Linux driver for fingerprint scanners by reverse engineering existing Windows drivers. The driver is designed to work across multiple Linux distributions and kernel versions.

## Hardware Support

- **Target Hardware**: [To be identified]
- **Vendor**: [To be determined]
- **Device ID**: [To be determined]
- **Interface**: [USB/PCI/etc - To be determined]

## Project Status

ðŸ”„ **In Development** - Currently in reverse engineering phase

### Current Phase: Information Gathering
- [ ] Hardware identification
- [ ] Windows driver analysis
- [ ] Protocol reverse engineering
- [ ] Linux kernel module development
- [ ] Testing and validation

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Linux kernel 4.19+ (for maximum compatibility)
- Development tools: gcc, make, kernel headers
- USB development libraries (if USB device)

### Supported Distributions
