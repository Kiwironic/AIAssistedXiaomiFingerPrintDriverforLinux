# Linux Fingerprint Scanner Driver

A reverse-engineered Linux driver for fingerprint scanners, ported from Windows drivers.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive Linux driver for fingerprint scanners by reverse engineering existing Windows drivers. The driver is designed to work across multiple Linux distributions and kernel versions.

## Hardware Support

- **Target Hardware**: FPC Fingerprint Reader (Disum)
- **Vendor**: Fingerprint Cards AB
- **Device ID**: VID:PID 10A5:9201
- **Interface**: USB

## Project Status

ðŸ”„ **In Development** - Hardware analysis complete, moving to libfprint research

### Current Phase: Research and Analysis âœ…
- [x] Hardware identification - **FPC Fingerprint Reader (Disum) VID:PID 10A5:9201**
- [x] Windows driver analysis - **Complete**
- [ ] Protocol reverse engineering - **Next Phase**
- [ ] Linux kernel module development - **Planned**
- [ ] Testing and validation - **Planned**

### Next Phase: libfprint Integration Research
- [ ] Check existing libfprint support for this device
- [ ] Analyze similar FPC implementations
- [ ] Plan development approach

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Linux kernel 4.19+ (for maximum compatibility)
- Development tools: gcc, make, kernel headers
- USB development libraries (if USB device)

### Supported Distributions
- Fedora 42+
- Ubuntu 20.04+
- Debian 11+
- CentOS/RHEL 8+
