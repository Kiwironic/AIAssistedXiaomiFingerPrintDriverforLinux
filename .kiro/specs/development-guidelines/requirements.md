# Development Guidelines and Quality Assurance Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the development guidelines, quality assurance rules, and automated enforcement mechanisms for the Linux Fingerprint Scanner Driver project. The goal is to ensure consistent, high-quality, well-documented, and maintainable code throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Understanding and Context Awareness

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want the system to ensure complete understanding of the project context before making any changes, so that all modifications are appropriate and aligned with project goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer attempts to add, update, or delete code THEN the system SHALL verify that the developer has reviewed relevant project documentation
2. WHEN making changes to existing functionality THEN the system SHALL require analysis of related components and dependencies
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL verify alignment with project architecture and existing patterns
4. IF project context is unclear THEN the system SHALL prompt for clarification before proceeding
5. WHEN working on driver components THEN the system SHALL ensure understanding of hardware specifications and protocol requirements

### Requirement 2: Documentation Synchronization and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all documentation to be automatically updated whenever code changes are made, so that documentation remains accurate and current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is added, modified, or deleted THEN the system SHALL update all relevant documentation
2. WHEN new modules are created THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding documentation templates
3. WHEN API interfaces change THEN the system SHALL update interface documentation automatically
4. WHEN architecture changes occur THEN the system SHALL update architecture diagrams and descriptions
5. WHEN new hardware support is added THEN the system SHALL update compatibility matrices and hardware documentation
6. IF documentation becomes outdated THEN the system SHALL flag inconsistencies and require updates

### Requirement 3: Objective Focus and Scope Management

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want the development process to stay focused on the core objective of creating a Linux fingerprint scanner driver, so that resources are used efficiently and scope creep is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are proposed THEN the system SHALL verify alignment with fingerprint scanner driver objectives
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL ensure they contribute to driver functionality
3. IF scope deviation is detected THEN the system SHALL alert and require justification
4. WHEN dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL verify they are necessary for driver operation
5. WHEN refactoring occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure it improves driver performance or maintainability

### Requirement 4: Code Redundancy Prevention and Reuse

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to prevent code duplication and promote reuse of existing functionality, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new functionality THEN the system SHALL check for existing similar implementations
2. WHEN creating new files THEN the system SHALL verify no duplicate functionality exists
3. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL suggest reusable components
4. IF code duplication is detected THEN the system SHALL recommend refactoring to shared modules
5. WHEN similar patterns are found THEN the system SHALL promote abstraction and common interfaces

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Documentation Standards

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want all code to be well-commented and follow consistent quality standards, so that the codebase is maintainable and understandable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL ensure comprehensive comments are included
2. WHEN functions are created THEN the system SHALL require documentation of parameters, return values, and purpose
3. WHEN complex algorithms are implemented THEN the system SHALL require detailed explanations
4. WHEN hardware protocols are implemented THEN the system SHALL require protocol documentation
5. IF code lacks sufficient comments THEN the system SHALL reject the changes until documentation is added
6. WHEN code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL verify adherence to coding standards

### Requirement 6: Modular Architecture and File Size Management

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want the codebase to maintain strict modularity with file size limits, so that the code remains manageable and follows good architectural principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are created or modified THEN the system SHALL enforce a maximum of 300 lines per file
2. WHEN a file approaches the line limit THEN the system SHALL suggest refactoring into multiple modules
3. WHEN new functionality is added THEN the system SHALL promote modular design patterns
4. IF a file exceeds 300 lines THEN the system SHALL require immediate refactoring
5. WHEN modules are created THEN the system SHALL ensure clear separation of concerns
6. WHEN dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL verify they maintain modular architecture

### Requirement 7: Coding Best Practices Enforcement

**User Story:** As a senior developer, I want all code to follow established best practices for Linux kernel development and C programming, so that the driver is reliable, secure, and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN C code is written THEN the system SHALL enforce Linux kernel coding style guidelines
2. WHEN memory is allocated THEN the system SHALL verify proper cleanup and error handling
3. WHEN system calls are made THEN the system SHALL ensure proper error checking
4. WHEN concurrency is used THEN the system SHALL verify proper synchronization mechanisms
5. WHEN hardware interfaces are accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure safe and atomic operations
6. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL require immediate fixes
7. WHEN performance-critical code is written THEN the system SHALL verify optimization best practices
