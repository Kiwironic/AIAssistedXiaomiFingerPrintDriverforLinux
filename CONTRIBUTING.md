## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

#### File Size Limit
- **Maximum 300 lines** per source file
- **Average target: 250 lines** for maintainability
- **Split large files** into logical components

#### Coding Style
- **Follow Linux kernel coding style** for kernel modules
- **Use consistent indentation** (tabs for kernel, spaces for user-space)
- **Meaningful variable names** and function names
- **Comprehensive comments** for complex logic

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Every function** must have a documentation header
- **Complex algorithms** must be explained
- **Hardware interactions** must be documented
- **Error conditions** must be described

Example function documentation:
```c
/**
 * Initialize fingerprint scanner hardware
 * 
 * This function performs the complete initialization sequence for the
 * fingerprint scanner, including power-on, firmware loading (if required),
 * and sensor calibration.
 *
 * @dev: Pointer to the fingerprint device structure
 * 
 * Returns 0 on success, negative error code on failure:
 * -EINVAL: Invalid device pointer
 * -EIO: Hardware communication failure
 * -ETIMEDOUT: Initialization timeout
 * -ENOMEM: Memory allocation failure
 */
static int fp_xiaomi_initialize_hardware(struct fp_xiaomi_device *dev)
{
    // Implementation...
}
```
